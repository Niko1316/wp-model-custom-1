# Nifty scroll events for jQuery

Adds slick new scroll events to jQuery (like `enter` and `leave`) so you can drop scrolling effects like a boss. Requires jQuery 1.11+.

## Usage

Load up `jquery.scrollex.min.js` (after jQuery):

```html
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.scrollex.min.js"></script>
```

Then call `scrollex()` on a selector with a **configuration object**, which is where you'll associate handlers with the events you want to use and set various Scrollex options (see **Configuration Reference** below). For example, this uses the `enter` and `leave` events to change the background color of `#foobar` to green when we scroll within its boundaries (its _contact area_), then back again when we scroll out of it:

```js
$(function() {
  $('#foobar').scrollex({
    enter: function() {

      // Set #foobar's background color to green when we scroll into it.
        $(this).css('background-color', 'green');

    },
    leave: function() {

      // Reset #foobar's background color when we scroll out of it.
        $(this).css('background-color', '');

    }
  });
});
```

## Events

Scrollex supports the following events:

### `enter`
Triggered when the viewport enters an element's contact area. Behavior can be tweaked using the `mode`, `top`, and `bottom` options (see next section).

### `leave`
Triggered when the viewport leaves an element's contact area. Behavior can be tweaked using the `mode`, `top`, and `bottom` options (see next section).

### `initialize`
Triggered as soon as `scrollex()` is called on an element.

### `terminate`
Triggered as soon as `unscrollex()` is called on an element, which is used to gracefully undo a previous `scrollex()` call.

### `scroll`
Triggered as the viewport scrolls through an element. The handler associated with this event is called with a normalized value representing how far the viewport has scrolled through the element (between `0` and `1`, although values outside this range are possible if the viewport is above or below the element). For example:

```js
$(function() {
  $('#foobar').scrollex({
    scroll: function(progress) {

      // Progressively increase #foobar's opacity as we scroll through it.
        $(this).css('opacity', Math.max(0, Math.min(1, progress)));

    }
  });
});
```

## `mode`, `top`, and `bottom`

Events that depend on the viewport's position relative to an element's contact area (currently just `enter` and `leave`) can be further tweaked using the `mode`, `top`, and `bottom` options.

### `mode`

This determines the rules Scrollex uses to figure out when the viewport is considered "inside" or "outside" an element's contact area. Can be any of the following:

Value         | Behavior
--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
`default`     | Element's contact area must fall within the viewport.
`top`         | Top viewport edge must fall within the element's contact area.
`bottom`      | Bottom viewport edge must fall within the element's contact area.
`middle`      | Midpoint between top/bottom viewport edges must fall within the element's contact area.

### `top` and `bottom`

These let you "pad" the edges of an element's contact area using either a pixel value (`150`) a percentage of that element's height (`25%`), or a percentage of the viewport's height (`20vh`). Positive values work inward and shrink the contact area, while negative values work outward and expand the contact area. For example, this expands the contact area of `#foobar` by 20% of its height in both directions, resulting in `enter` triggering a bit earlier and `leave` a bit later:

```js
$(function() {
  $('#foobar').scrollex({
    top: '-20%',
    bottom: '-20%',
    enter: function() {
      $(this).css('background-color', 'green');

    },
    leave: function() {
      $(this).css('background-color', '');
    }
  });
});
```

## Configuration Reference

Name         | Type                | Default   | Description
-------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------------------
`enter`      | `function`          | `null`    | **Enter** event.
`leave`      | `function`          | `null`    | **Leave** event.
`initialize` | `function`          | `null`    | **Initialize** event.
`terminate`  | `function`          | `null`    | **Terminate** event.
`scroll`     | `function`          | `null`    | **Scroll** event.
`mode`       | `string`            | `default` | Mode (`default`, `top`, `bottom`, or `middle`).
`top`        | `integer`, `string` | `0`       | Top padding (in pixels, `%`, `vh`).
`bottom`     | `integer`, `string` | `0`       | Bottom padding (in pixels, `%`, or `vh`).
`delay`      | `integer`           | `0`       | Delay (in ms) between position checks.
